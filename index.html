  <p>I’ve been working/supporting and managing (ERP) Enterprise Resource Planning systems since 1999. I started with PeopleSoft as the foundation of working with relational databases. I’ve been very fortunate to work with Developers early on…this
    exposure has help me to understand the importance of building relationships, understanding technical aspects and identifying functional requirements. Overall, helps me bridge the gap between “IT” (Technology) and the Managers (Business).</p>
  <p>I’ve managed multiple platforms (PSoft, Oracle, Success Factors, Ceridian, etc.) and have overseen the data from Hire to Retire/Termination, and account for any changes within the employee’s history. I've maintained foundation tables,
    administered security, and generated any system (adhoc) reports as needed. I’ve worked in a variety of industries and understand the complexities of a company hierarchy, especially when the company is a global entity with a headcount over 50k. I
    believe all employees are clients, and should be treated with outstanding customer service.</p>
  <p>I am an IT Professional with strong analytical and problem solving experience in implementation and maintenance of HRIS systems. I've managed large data sets ensuring quality, integrity and confidentiality. Partnered with key business
    stakeholders providing critical information. Leveraged solid background in Compensation and broad knowledge of HR business processes. Collaborated with all organizational levels focusing on internal and external customer satisfaction. Applied
    problem solving skills resolving configuration, reporting and system integrity issues.</p>
  <p>My work at Mount Sinai started with joining a specialized team whose primary objective was to train our Employees and Hiring Managers to fully leverage our Applicant Tracking Sysytem (ATS) called Taleo. This expanded to include our
    Recruiters/Onboarders in Talent Acquisition across hospital campuses throughout the Mount Sinai network. My role transitioned to becoming a Recruiter specializing in Union recruiting, though I continued to train staff as needed. A year later, I
    transferred to the Data and Analytics team as an IT Project Manager. I was the Project Manager for the implementation of our Career Portal, which is hosted by iCIMs. I am currently working on developing my skillset to include Programming(Python,
    Javascript) and Web Development.</p>

  <h3>Projects and Future Initiatives</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Single Sign-on (SSO)</strong>: The implementation and launch of Single Sign-on (SSO) across the Mount Sinai Health System. This provided a secure and efficient way for accessing Taleo, allowing hundreds of Hiring Managers, Talent
      Acquisition, HRIS, HR Leads, and various Position Control groups to log in seamlessly with their existing network credentials. This initiative increased productivity and reduced overall request submitted to Taleo Tech Support by 33% percent.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Data cleanup</strong>: Updated generic job descriptions for more than 5,000 job templates in Taleo, this incorporated specific branding approved by Jane for our requisitions across the Mount Sinai Health System. Merged duplicate
      profiles for hundreds of Applicant records while training the Recruiters on how to proactively review a record and avoid extending an Offer on external profiles for Candidates that are existing employees. Email addresses were fixed as part of
      the consolidation of accounts, old chpnet email addresses were replaced for employees while external applicants with multiple profiles selected the email of their preference. The Offer Letter process has been updated along with Candidate
      profile to include “City, State, County, Zip code” field correspond fields required in the Cloud.</li>
    <li><strong>Automation with (Kantu)</strong>: I've developed scripts to automate User Acceptance Testing (UAT) for Jibe/iCIMs, Taleo, and working within Dev 2 & Dev 3. With Jibe/iCIMs, I created scripts to walk through a registration, a
      first-time
      applicant completing their first submission, and a returning applicant. On the Taleo end, I mirrored the application process for an internal employee. For Dev 2 & Dev 3, I developed scripts to sign in, download a library of reports, and
      generate an
      email when that process was completed. That specific script addressed a challenge my colleague Eric experienced with the extensive time he spent running those same reports manually. Kantu allowed me the ability to create scripts for both
      desktop
      and web automation. A cost effective skill set that saved time and has massive potential with future upgrades and testing in the Cloud.</li>
    <li><strong>Career Portal Enhancements</strong>: I've worked to drastically improve the Career portal on all fronts. The “Home Page” has been expanded to include dedicated pages for Alex Cano’s Physicians, and the addition of
      Development/Fundraising
      to coincide with the new job category created in Taleo. My efforts have increased functionality, streamlined the application process, and improved the User experience on both desktop and mobile devices</li>
